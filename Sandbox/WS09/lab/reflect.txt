I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that
my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments */
/******************************************************************/

Upon completion of this workshop, I gained practical insights into various key concepts and 
techniques within object-oriented programming.A fundamental principle I applied pertains to the
Rule of Three, particularly when dealing with derived classes managing resources. This rule 
underscores the importance of defining a custom destructor, copy constructor, and 
copy assignment operator, particularly in scenarios involving dynamically allocated memory. 
The implementation of this rule, especially within the context of derived classes, 
significantly deepened my comprehension of resource management in object-oriented programming.

However, a notable challenge arose in grasping the intricacies of deep copying and 
memory management. The meticulous application of the Rule of Three, particularly within
a derived class, necessitated an attention to detail. Ensuring the proper copying and 
release of dynamically allocated memory, and preventing memory leaks, demanded careful scrutiny 
of every code snippet.
