-REFLECTION PART-

Learning Objective:
•	Create default and overloaded constructor
•	Create destructors
•	Initialize class member variables
•	Release member pointers

Constructor is created with same name of class and could take argument or created with no arguments.
I created many constructors for workshop 4 with or without arguments. Constructor without arguments
is employed to set member variables to nullptr or zero. On the other hand, destructor is utilized 
to release memory that is created dynamically. Otherwise, it brings about memory leak having 
serious impact on the application performance. 

I declared member variable in the class as a private and initialize it through member methods. 
This is safer to keep class data private to other class. Besides, it facilitates allocate memory 
dynamically. For example, I created a pointer in the class and point it to character array
based on given information. It allows me to use memory more wisely. 
However, it comes with responsibility that deallocate memory manually. 
Therefore, I employed destructor to release pointer and gave back the memory I utilized.
